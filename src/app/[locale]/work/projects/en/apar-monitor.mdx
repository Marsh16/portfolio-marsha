title: "APAR Monitor: Airport Fire Extinguisher Checklist System"
publishedAt: "2025-04-21"
summary: "Ensuring fire safety in airports, APAR Monitor streamlines the inspection process of light fire extinguishers across airport zones.

Manual APAR inspections are prone to inconsistency and data loss. APAR Monitor transforms this workflow by enabling digital checklist submission, zone-based tracking, and real-time reporting via a modern web interface. Inspectors scan barcodes on fire extinguishers, fill out a structured checklist, and submit condition reports directly from the field. Admins can view inspection histories, export reports, and ensure safety compliance—making the process faster, more accurate, and audit-friendly. Built with performance in mind, the system leverages a clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS."

## Overview

APAR Monitor is a modern web app that digitizes the inspection of airport fire extinguishers (APAR). Each extinguisher is associated with a barcode and a specific zone. Inspectors can scan, check, and log the condition of APAR units, while administrators monitor inspection records across all zones.

The platform reduces manual error, enhances traceability, and increases the efficiency of routine fire safety operations.

## Key Features

- **Barcode Scanning**: Identify APARs instantly via webcam barcode scanner.
- **Checklist Submission**: Log conditions (pressure, safety pin, hose) via interactive form.
- **Zone Overview**: View APARs by location using dynamic mapping visuals.
- **PDF Report Export**: Generate and download checklist reports as PDFs.
- **Role Management**: Inspector and Admin roles with tailored views and permissions.
- **Inspection Log**: Access and filter historical inspection data.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for lightweight and responsive UI.
- **Scanner**: react-qr-barcode-scanner for in-browser scanning.
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore for real-time data and authentication.
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF to export inspection records.
- **Deployment**: Vercel for fast and seamless deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore, Firebase Authentication
- **Libraries**: react-qr-barcode-scanner, jsPDF
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## Challenges and Learnings

Barcode scanning across different devices was a key challenge, requiring fallback handling for low-resolution cameras and permissions. Managing inspection roles securely and creating a dynamic form-to-PDF pipeline also pushed the project’s architectural design.

Key learnings included:
- Writing scalable React components with Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- Implementing secure role-based access in Firebase.
- Building responsive, offline-aware interfaces.
- Structuring Firestore data efficiently for both real-time UI updates and archival reporting.

## Outcome

APAR Monitor is live at [apar-monitor.vercel.app](https://apar-monitor.vercel.app/), used to inspect fire extinguishers in real airport environments. It enhances safety compliance, saves time, and digitizes what was once a pen-and-paper task—proving the value of well-designed web tools in operational workflows.

This project reflects my full-stack capabilities and ability to deliver production-ready tools tailored to real-world needs.
