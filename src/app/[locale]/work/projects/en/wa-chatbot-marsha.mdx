## Overview

WA Chatbot Marsha is an intelligent customer service automation solution built for Toko Marsha, demonstrating advanced integration of workflow automation, artificial intelligence, and multi-platform deployment. This project showcases the power of no-code/low-code solutions combined with sophisticated backend orchestration to create a seamless customer experience.

The chatbot handles three core business functions: store reservations with automated calendar integration, product catalog distribution, and intelligent FAQ responses. Built using n8n for workflow automation, GPT-4.1 for natural language processing, and deployed using modern containerization with Sumopod, this project represents a complete end-to-end automation solution.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Reservation System
- **Automated Booking Flow**: Customers initiate reservations through natural conversation
- **Form Integration**: Seamless handoff to structured reservation forms
- **Email Confirmation**: Automated confirmation emails sent upon successful booking
- **Calendar Sync**: Real-time integration with Google Calendar for schedule management
- **Conflict Prevention**: Smart scheduling to avoid double-bookings

### Dynamic Product Catalog
- **On-Demand Delivery**: PDF catalog automatically sent when customers inquire about products
- **Context-Aware Responses**: AI determines when to trigger product information sharing
- **Document Management**: Centralized product catalog with easy updates
- **Rich Media Support**: Support for images, descriptions, and pricing information

### AI-Powered FAQ System
- **Natural Language Understanding**: GPT-4.1 processes customer queries in conversational language
- **Business Hours Information**: Automated responses for store hours and contact details
- **Product Inquiries**: Intelligent routing between general info and detailed catalog
- **Contextual Responses**: Maintains conversation context for multi-turn interactions

### Enterprise Integration
- **Google Workspace**: Full integration with Gmail, Calendar, and Sheets
- **WhatsApp Business API**: Professional messaging with WAHA container deployment
- **n8n Orchestration**: Visual workflow automation with error handling and monitoring

## Technologies Used

- **Workflow Automation**: n8n for visual workflow design and execution
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4.1 for natural language processing and response generation
- **Messaging Platform**: WhatsApp API via WAHA (WhatsApp HTTP API) container
- **Cloud Integration**: Google Workspace APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Sheets)
- **Deployment**: Sumopod, containerized n8n and WAHA deployment
- **Document Management**: File sending
- **Email Automation**: SMTP integration for confirmation emails

## Tech Stack

- **Automation Platform**: n8n (Node-based workflow automation)
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4.1 API
- **Messaging**: WAHA (WhatsApp HTTP API) Container
- **Integration**: Google APIs (Calendar, Gmail, Sheets)
- **Deployment**: Sumopod, Docker containers

## Architecture Highlights

### Microservices Design
The solution employs a microservices architecture where each component handles specific business logic:
- **Message Router**: Processes incoming WhatsApp messages and determines intent
- **AI Processor**: Handles natural language understanding and response generation
- **Reservation Engine**: Manages booking logic and calendar integration
- **Document Service**: Handles product catalog requests and PDF delivery
- **Notification System**: Manages email confirmations and alerts

### Scalable Deployment
- **Container Orchestration**: WAHA deployed in isolated containers for reliability
- **API Rate Limiting**: Intelligent handling of WhatsApp API limits
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms

## Challenges and Learnings

### Integration Complexity
Managing multiple APIs and services required careful orchestration and error handling. The n8n workflow needed to handle various failure scenarios while maintaining a smooth user experience.

### AI Response Quality
Fine-tuning GPT-4.1 responses to maintain brand voice while providing accurate business information required iterative prompt engineering and context management.

### WhatsApp API Limitations
Working within WhatsApp's messaging policies and rate limits required implementing intelligent queuing and message batching strategies.

### Real-time Synchronization
Ensuring data consistency across Google Calendar, Supabase, and the chatbot required implementing proper event handling and conflict resolution.

## Business Impact

- **24/7 Availability**: Customers can interact with the store outside business hours
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Automated reservation handling saves staff time
- **Improved Customer Experience**: Instant responses and seamless booking process
- **Data Collection**: Automated capture of customer interactions and preferences
- **Scalability**: System can handle multiple concurrent conversations

This project demonstrates the power of modern automation tools and AI integration to create sophisticated business solutions without traditional heavy development overhead.
